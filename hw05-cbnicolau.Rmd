# Homework 05: Factor and figure management

Load required libraries
```{r load libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(gridExtra)
```


##Part 1: Factor management

First check the structure of the data set and ensure there are variables which are **factors**

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

We can see that indeed the variables `country` and `continent` are factors

1. Drop factor / levels;

**Drop Oceania.** Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the continent of Oceania. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

Let's filter the data first

```{r}
(gapminder_notOceania <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania"))
```

And investigate it's structure
```{r}
str(gapminder_notOceania) 
levels(gapminder_notOceania$continent)
nlevels(gapminder_notOceania$continent)
```
We can see from looking at the structure that `Oceania` is still a level of the `continent` factor, and the number of levels in `contient` is still 5, but because `gapminder_notOceania` has fewer observations (1680 rows) than the unmodified `gapminder` (1704 rows), we can see that we effectively filtered out all the cuntries in Oceania

Let's confirm this with a plot:

```{r explore factors}
ggplot(gapminder_notOceania, aes(continent)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(drop=FALSE) #to prevent ggplot from dropping the unused factors automatically
```

Now let's drop the unused levels

```{r}
gapminder_notOceania %>%
  droplevels() %>%
  str()
```

Now we see that the variable `continent` has only 4 levels.


2. Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.

**Reorder the levels of country or continent.** Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.

Let's filter the data for just the year 2007, and reorder the plot

```{r reorder median}
gapminder_notOceania %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent,gdpPercap)) %>% #reorder according to the median, increasing
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes())
```

Now let's try reordering according to the mean

```{r reorder_mean}
gapminder_NO <- gapminder_notOceania %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent,gdpPercap, mean)) %>% #reorder according to the mean, increasing
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes()) 

gapminder_NO
```


3. Explore the effects of arrange(). Does merely arranging the data have any effect on, say, a figure?

First, plot `gdpPercap` for each country without any particular order (alphabetical by default)

```{r not ordered}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap , y = country)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Let's try `arrange()`

```{r arranged}
arranged_gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(gdpPercap)

ggplot(arranged_gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap , y = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

When only using `arrange()` and saving to the object it doesn't seem to make any difference for the plot. Let's inspect this object:

```{r}
arranged_gapminder %>%
  head(30) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

We see that `arrange()`does arrange the items in the order we wanted, it's just that when plotting this order is not preserved.

4. Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with arrange(). Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?

Let's now use `fct_reorder()` to sort the countries by ascending `gdpPercap`

```{r reordered}
reordered_gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap))
  
ggplot(reordered_gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap , y = country)) +
  geom_point()
```

After reordering the countries according to `gdpPercap` the figure plots the sorted countries.
Let's have a look at the actual data now

```{r reordered gapminder check}
reordered_gapminder %>%
  head(30) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Looking at the table it seems like the actual data has not been sorted.

Now let's couple `fct_reorder()` with `arrange()`

```{r reorder and arrange}
reordered_arranged_gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange(gdpPercap)
  
ggplot(reordered_arranged_gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap , y = country)) +
  geom_point()

reordered_arranged_gapminder %>%
  head(30) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Using both functions seems to work for the actual data too (not only the figure).

## Part 2: File I/O
Experiment with one or more of write_csv()/read_csv() (and/or TSV friends), saveRDS()/readRDS(),  dput()/dget(). Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Singer or Gapminder. I highly recommend you fiddle with the factor levels, i.e. make them non-alphabetical (see previous section). Explore whether this survives the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.

Let's save the `reordered_arranged_gapminder` dataset in a new `.csv` file.

```{r save to file}
write_csv(reordered_arranged_gapminder, "RA_gapminder.csv")
```

Let's read it now

```{r read from file}
RA_gapminder <- read_csv("RA_gapminder.csv")

head(RA_gapminder, 30) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


## Part 3: Visualization design

Remake at least one figure or create a new one, in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. Maybe juxtapose your first attempt and what you obtained after some time spent working on it. Reflect on the differences. If using Gapminder, you can use the country or continent color scheme that ships with Gapminder. Consult the dimensions listed in All the Graph Things.

```{r gapminder without oceania embelished}
gapminder_NO2 <- gapminder_notOceania %>% #save into new object
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(continent = fct_reorder(continent,gdpPercap, mean)) %>% #reorder according to the mean, increasing
  ggplot(aes(continent, gdpPercap)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = continent), alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = continent)) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = 10^(1:6)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="none")

compare_plots <- grid.arrange(gapminder_NO, gapminder_NO2, ncol = 2)
compare_plots
```


Then, make a new graph by converting this visual (or another, if youâ€™d like) to a plotly graph. What are some things that plotly makes possible, that are not possible with a regular ggplot2 graph?

```{r plotly}
library(plotly)
#ggplotly(gapminder_NO2)
```

The `plotly()` is a more interactive graph, for example, you can easily the values of each point in the graph, zoom in, and see the exact values of the summary statistics (quartiles, mean, median)  

**Note:** I had to comment out the plotly call because otherwise the knit would be haulted

## Part 4: Writing figures to file

Use ggsave() to explicitly save a plot to file. Then use `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)` to load and embed it in your report. You can play around with various options, such as:

- Arguments of ggsave(), such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
- Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.
- Explicit provision of the plot object p via ggsave(..., plot = p). 
- Show a situation in which this actually matters.

Let's save the comparison plot into a file

```{r save plot to file}
ggsave("compare_plots.png", compare_plots, width = 10, height = 7)
```

And try to call it to embed it to the report ![like this](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw05-cbnicolau/blob/master/compare_plots.png?raw=true)
